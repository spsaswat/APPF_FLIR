# Setup Instructions

## 1. Activating the Conda Environment

To begin working with the project, we need to activate the specified Conda environment. This ensures that all dependencies and the correct Python version are used. The command is:
```bash
conda activate appf-flir
```
Before using this command, ensure that the directory is 
```bash
D:\techlauncher\APPF_FLIR
```

This command activates the appf-flir environment.


## 2. Launching JupyterLab

Once the Conda environment is activated, we can start JupyterLab. Use the following command:
```bash
jupyter lab
```
This command starts JupyterLab, opening a browser window where you can access and work on your notebooks. If the browser does not automatically open, we can manually navigate to the URL provided in the terminal output.
