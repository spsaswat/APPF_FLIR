# APPF Overview

The Australian Plant Phenomics Facility (APPF) is a world-leading infrastructure facility that underpins innovative plant phenomics research to accelerate the development of new and improved crops, healthier food and more sustainable agricultural practice. We currently have nodes at the University of Adelaide and the Australian National University.


# APPF_FLIR Project Overview

This project aims to develop an advanced phenotyping system using a customized 3D hyperspectral scanner that can accurately identify the expression of food-grade recombinant proteins within plant leaves. This system is intended to streamline the process of phenotypic data collection and analysis, ultimately enhancing the breeding and cultivation of plants with desired traits.


## FLIR A645 SC Camera Overview

We are using FLIR A645 SC camera for thermal imaging. The FLIR A645 SC camera offers high-resolution long-wave infrared (LWIR) imaging, making it an ideal tool for scientific and research applications. Key features include:

- **Resolution:** 640 × 480 pixels resolution for detailed imaging.
- **Thermal Sensitivity:** Thermal sensitivity <50 mK at +30°C (+86°F) for accurate temperature measurement.
- **Temperature Range:** Temperature range of -20° to +650°C for diverse applications.
- **Connectivity:** 25 Hz gigabit ethernet connectivity, compatible with GiGE Vision and GenICam.
- **Lens:** Removable 24.5mm lens with a 25° x 18.8° field of view; interior threads for filters.

## Testing Software
we are using FLIR Thermal Studio Suite to receive data generated by the FLIR thermal camera. In the circumstance of this project, it is considered to be the testing software for the developed algorithm. The software could be download [here](https://www.flir.com.au/support/products/flir-thermal-studio-suite/#Downloads).
